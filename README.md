# DiscordVerificationBot

I wrote this code to be used for the Penn State University discord server, in order to automate verifying that a given email is that of an active student (through comparing the email with the Penn State student directory), and then giving the user the basic members role on the discord server. Previously all verification had been done manually, so this helped to save a lot of time while still working to prevent spam bots from joining the server. Written mostly in Python, with a small function in Javascript to utilize the student directory API.
